      "content" : "In this world there exists two types of people. The first type is that who can wield the power of the elements and use them for their own needs, these people are called mages. The other type of people are not so lucky for they have no magical abilities, these people are reffered to as mortals. These two camps of people lived in harmony, until one day a mortal named Mercury decided that the power balance between mages and mortals had been skewed for too long and needed to change. The great magic war then started. The mages were lead by the oldest and strongest mage of that time, Chronos. Chronos specialized in magic that dealt with the local manipulation of time. Mercury was leading the mortals and used hybrid magical weaponery. This weaponery was the only way the mortals were able to fight against the mages. These weapons were developed by Apollan, a mortal. The war eventually ended when Haden, a mage specializing in dark magic, sacrificed himself to kill Mercury and many other mortals. After the war a council, called The Defenders of the Realm, was formed so that nothing of this magnitude ever occured again. The council proclaimed the formation of guilds that consisted of mage and mortals to keep the peace of the realm. As for the hybrid weaponery, some of it was saved from the remmants of the war as well as blueprints. Now because of the war mortals and mages fight along side each other trying to keep the peace and protect the realm from darkness."
